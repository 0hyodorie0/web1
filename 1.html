  <h2>My Idol</h2>
  I like Britney Spears. I have liked her <strong>since I was <u>8 years old</u>.</strong> She's still my star.
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Britney Jean Spears</a> (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress.
  Born in McComb, Mississippi and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, she appeared in stage productions
  and television series, before signing with Jive Records in 1997.<br> Spears's first two studio albums,
  ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), were global successes
  and made her the best-selling teenage artist of all-time. Referred to as the "Princess of Pop",
  Spears was regarded as a pop icon and credited with influencing the revival of teen pop
  during the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:44px;">Billboard ranked her as the eighth biggest artist of the 2000s decade. One of the world's best-selling
  music artists, Spears has sold over 150 million records worldwide and more than 70 million records
  in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.
  In the United States, Spears remains the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era,
  as well as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s. In 2004, she launched a perfume brand
  with Elizabeth Arden, Inc., from which sales exceeded US$1.5 billion, as of 2012. The singer serves
  as one of the few artists in history to have a number one single and studio album in the US
  during each of the three decades of their careerâ€”1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. Spears has topped the list
  of most searched celebrities seven times in 12 years, a record since the inception of the internet.</p>
